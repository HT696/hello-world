# hello-world
a place for ideas ? not sure
maybe add a list of things I want to be translated?


needs persian translation:
blixt-wallet: https://github.com/hsjoberg/blixt-wallet  

Robosats: https://github.com/Reckless-Satoshi/robosats

ideas:
couldn't find a nostr relay project (dockr img?) pre-configured to host only the chats with the relay owner
would be useful for customer support chat
